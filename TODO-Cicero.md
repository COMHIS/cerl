* Tue 1/2017

- Add edition field in the data (helps with duplicate identification)
- Add/Remove the remaining updates with the names (see below)
- Clean place names for Cicero
- Group the entries by place & year & language + alphabetic ordering for titles
- Associate Tue's abbreviations (Cicero\ abbreviations*.csv/xlsx picked from OCD.ABBREVIATIONS.pdf by Tue and added some modifications, see [1] below) to CERL titles. The list has a more general purpose and could be used more widely in cleaning up catalog title fields. It is made as a general help for students and scholars within classics so it includes all kinds of relevant abbreviations. But since the OCD is a standard work within the field and the list is now (since Sep. 2016) publicly available I was thinking that we could use these abbreviations and then link to the OCD site: http://classics.oxfordre.com/page/abbreviation-list/x

- Remove unnecessary languages - just keep the language name column
  (not the TRUE/FALSE version)
- Luther, Voltaire, Cicero -> Could we use Eetu's point and click tool here
- Check why CERL top author summary page shows so few documents
  (Cicero ~ 200 docs although Tue had 14000 entries..)
- Clean up by summer and then article writing during fall 2017 ?
- The list of Ciceronian work titles was not as complete as I remembered it to be, but it can be found here: http://dge.cchs.csic.es/lst/lst1.htm I will send you a complete list shortly.



[1] I now found a complete, and as least as authoritative and common, list of abbreviations, that of the Oxford Classical Dictionary, which I propose that we follow. Since this list has been made as a help to decipher abbreviations in other works, however, it sometimes gives several forms. This goes for the following works: Pro lege Manilia (also called De imperio Cn. Pompeii): I propose that we use the abbreviation Leg. Man. and The Academicae Quaestiones: Cicero made two different versions of this work and different parts of both are preserved today. I suppose that they will mainly have been printed together, in which case I propose that we use the abbreviation Acad.  If they are ever printed separately I think we should use Acad. post. to refer to the Academica posteriora (also called Lucullus) and Acad. pr. to refer to the Academica priora (also called Varro). Finally, I mentioned some works incorrectly ascribed to Cicero (the author is, I think, always listed as Pseudo Cicero in the data). I think we should delete all three from our data. The Rhetorica ad Herennium was only regarded as Ciceronian from the 4th-15th century (at least that is what Der kleine Pauly says under the entry ‘Ad Herennium’).  The Consolatio is a Renaissance forgery recognized as such already by the forger’s/author's contemporaries (There is a pretty thorough Wikipedia entry about this text, and the lost Ciceronian original). The Synonyma seems to be a list of synonyms loosely connected to Cicero’s works and preserved in some Carolingian manuscripts (See review of the modern edition of the text). An edition was published several times around 1500 and it seems to have been presented as a list produced by Cicero himself. I was not able to find out how the text was regarded in later times but given its list-/dictionary-like character it cannot have been studied as a work by Cicero in the same sense as his prose works. Therefore I think we should delete it from the data. Does this make sense?
